# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Jammify - A Music Playlist Application
Jammify is a web application that allows users to search for music tracks, create playlists, and manage their favorite songs. With Jammify, users can easily search for songs, add them to their playlists, and enjoy their personalized music collections.

Technologies Used
React: The project is built using the React library, providing a component-based architecture for building user interfaces.
Features
Search Bar: Users can enter song names, album names, or artist names in the search bar to find relevant music tracks.

Search Results: The search results are displayed in real-time as users type in the search bar. Each result shows the song name, artist name, and album name.

Add to Playlist: Users can add desired tracks from the search results to their playlist by clicking the "Add" button associated with each track.

Playlist Management: Users can manage their playlists by viewing, rearranging, and removing tracks.

Future Work
Jammify is a starting point for a music playlist application, and there are several features and improvements that can be added in the future:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication and accounts to enable personalized playlists for each user.

API Integration: Connect the application to a real music streaming API, such as the Spotify API, to fetch actual music tracks and metadata.

Drag and Drop: Enhance the playlist management experience by allowing users to rearrange tracks using drag and drop.

Playlist Sharing: Add the ability for users to share their playlists with others through unique links.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the application is fully responsive to work on various screen sizes and devices.

Enhanced Styling: Improve the visual design of the application with more appealing and user-friendly styles.

Additional Filters: Implement filters for refining search results, such as filtering by genre or release year.
